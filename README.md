# **Horiseon Website Refactor**

## **Project Overview**

For this project, I refactored the Horiseon Website to make it more accessible. To do this, I replaced general HTML elements with semantic elements. I also added accessible alt attributes to the image elements, and I provided a concise, descriptive title to the title element.

This project helped me learn more about how to make the web more accessible. I also gained additional skills in Git, GitHub, and HTML.

## **Installation**

N/A

## **Usage**

This is a business website that allows all prospective customers to access and understand the services provided by Horiseon.

The HTML also shows attention to accessible web design.


## **Credits**

The starter code was provided by the Coding Bootcamp.
